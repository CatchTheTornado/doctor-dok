# TERMS OF SERVICE

Last Updated: 22.09.2024

**These Terms of Service** (these “**Terms**”) govern your access to, and use of, Doctor Dok (the “**App**”) and the access management site (collectively, the “**Services**”) provided by CT Tornado sp. z o. o. with its registered office in Wrocław, Poland (address: ul. Wyspa Słodowa 7, 50-266 Wrocław; registration: District Court Wrocław-Fabryczna, KRS number: 783910; tax ID no.: 8982262377; share capital: PLN 5 000,00; email address: info@catchthetornado.com; “**CTT**”, “**we,**" “**us**,” or “**our**”).

The Services are provided entirely electronically and are intended for use by adults only. By accessing or using the Services, you acknowledge that you are an adult and agree to be bound by these Terms. If you do not agree to these Terms or if you are not an adult, do not use the Services.

1. **Description of Services**
    1. **Beta Access**: The App is currently in beta and provided free of charge with a limited allocation of AI tokens per user, for testing purposes. During the beta phase, you can create one encrypted database to test the App’s functionalities. Your feedback is invaluable to us as it supports the enhancement and refinement of the Services. Please ensure that any data entered into the App during this phase is removed, anonymized, or obfuscated, as the use of real, identifiable personal data does not align with the objectives of beta testing and may lead to privacy risks and liabilities.
    2. **Functional Overview**: The App enables you to create an encrypted database within your browser, organized into records and folders for managing medical data, including text and attachments, all securely encrypted. It offers AI-driven features like data analysis, translation, and data digitization, converting various formats into structured data. The App includes a chat feature powered by AI for interactive queries and insights. It also supports removing personally identifiable information to enhance privacy. Uploads are subject to file size limits to ensure efficient storage and processing.
    3. **ChatGPT Integration**: The App leverages certain AI components to enhance its functionalities, including data analysis, translation, and privacy tools. Among these, ChatGPT is used for specific features.
        - ChatGPT's Influence on Outputs: CHATGPT’S LIMITATIONS CAN DIRECTLY IMPACT THE APP, RESULTING IN OUTPUTS THAT MAY NOT ALWAYS BE RELIABLE OR CONSISTENT WITH EXPECTATIONS. YOU SHOULD NOTE THAT CHATGPT OUTPUTS AND OTHER AI-GENERATED RESULTS MAY NOT ALWAYS BE ACCURATE AND SHOULD NOT BE SOLELY RELIED UPON FOR FACTUAL INFORMATION OR PROFESSIONAL ADVICE. SOME OUTPUTS MAY REFLECT THE AI’S LIMITATIONS RATHER THAN PROVIDING USEFUL OR EXPECTED RESULTS.
        - Data Handling and Security: The App ensures that your data remains encrypted and within the browser environment. CTT is bound to a Data Processing Agreement (DPA) with OpenAI, ensuring compliance with data protection standards. Data handled by AI tools may be retained for up to 30 days to support service quality. Compliance with data protection standards like GDPR is maintained.
        - Usage Restrictions and Responsibilities: You should be aware of usage restrictions, particularly around commercial use and data handling. As an end-user, your interaction with AI-driven features is managed by the App, which handles all settings and configurations. Your responsibility is to use the features in line with the App’s guidelines on privacy and data usage.
2. **Data Security, Privacy, and Account Management**
    1. **End-to-End Encryption and Data Control**: The App employs end-to-end encryption to ensure that all uploaded (medical and the like) data is encrypted with your specific key, which is never shared with us. We do not have access to the contents of your encrypted data. All such data is securely transmitted with SSL encryption and stored on servers located in the EU. Uploaded data is stored in a separate, end-to-end encrypted vault that we cannot access or read. This data is converted and stored in a standardized, secure format, supporting functionalities such as digitization and AI-driven analysis. You have the ability to add or revoke additional access keys, providing full control over your data and access permissions.
    2. **Access Management and Account Creation:** To use the Services, you must create an account by providing a valid email address, a database ID, and an encryption key (or password). Access to the App begins with a landing page where you can request beta access by providing your email, name, company name (optional), and position (optional). Once beta access is granted, you will receive a link allowing you to create a personal database within the App. The information provided during the beta access request (including your email, name, company name, and position) is stored in a separate administrative system accessible to us as data controllers and is processed solely for beta testing purposes, such as sending access credentials and managing participation. You are responsible for keeping your account credentials, especially your encryption key, secure and confidential. Do not share your encryption key with anyone; if lost, it cannot be recovered, rendering your data permanently inaccessible as it is not stored anywhere.
    3. **Security Features and Technical Requirements:** The App includes security features like multi-folder support, data encryption, secure sharing options, and access from multiple devices, including mobile and desktop. It runs entirely within your browser and relies on a secure, modern browser to function correctly. To mitigate risks, you can create and save backup data keys. The App also allows for data export and import through an unencrypted ZIP file, stored as a backup, with the process occurring entirely within your browser to ensure no unencrypted data is transmitted to our servers. It is your responsibility to keep your browser up-to-date and secure, as we are not liable for issues arising from browser-related vulnerabilities or internet connectivity problems.
3. **User Responsibilities**
    1. **Purpose and Use**: The App is designed for interacting with medical information primarily through pre-set queries and structured data management.
        - Query Guidelines: These pre-set queries set the tone for acceptable use, guiding how other queries should be formulated. Certain queries may be expressly or technically blocked due to ethical, legal, or other good reasons. You should use the App in a manner consistent with these boundaries, avoiding chatting or any queries that do not align with the App’s intended purpose.
        - Medical Disclaimer: The App is not a medical practitioner and is not a certified medical device. By using the App, you accept that any information provided is for informational and popular science purposes only and not for medical advice. In case of any doubts, questions, needs, or symptoms, you agree to contact a qualified healthcare professional or doctor.
    2. **Accuracy and Anonymization**: You are responsible for ensuring that all information you provide is accurate, current, and complete. Avoid uploading personal or sensitive information you do not wish to be processed. Before entering any data into the App, remove, obfuscate, or anonymize personal information to safeguard privacy.
    3. **Compliance and Prohibited Activities**: You must comply with all applicable laws and regulations, especially those governing the handling of medical and personal data. You are responsible for ensuring that the data you store does not involve unlawful activities. Do not attempt to access the Services through unauthorized methods, bypass security measures, or engage in activities that could disrupt or interfere with the App’s operation. Abuse of the App, such as entering illegal, inappropriate, or unauthorized data, is strictly prohibited.
        - Data Pre-Qualification Feature: The App includes a security feature that automatically rejects data determined by ChatGPT to be non-medical during a pre-qualification process. Any data rejection based on this process is intentional and not a system error.
        - Liability and Actions for Unlawful Data: CTT has no direct access to the contents of the data you upload to the App due to our end-to-end encryption protocols. As such, we are not liable for any unlawful data or related activities that may be stored within the App without our knowledge. If we receive official notice or obtain reliable knowledge of the unlawful nature of stored data or related activities, we will take action to restrict access to such data by disabling access at the system level and will promptly inform you of these actions. We are not liable for any damages resulting from restricting access to unlawful data when such actions are based on official notices or reliable knowledge, and appropriate notifications are provided. You agree to cooperate with us to address any issues related to the unlawful nature of the data, including providing clarifications or removing the data if required.
4. **App Functionalities**
    1. **Medical Data Management**: The App allows you to upload, store, and manage medical data in various formats, including PDF, JPG, PNG, and text. While there are no imposed limits on the amount of data you can store, each file upload is subject to a size limit of 100MB.
    2. **AI-Driven Features**: The App includes AI-powered functionalities such as:
        - ChatGPT Integration: Used to analyze medical data and answer queries. Users should understand that ChatGPT outputs may not always be accurate and should not be solely relied upon for factual information or professional advice.
        - Non-Diagnostic Suggestions: Provides insights based on user-provided data, highlighting potential areas of concern, such as risks for conditions like diabetes or cancer. These suggestions are not diagnostic and should be used as a guide, not as a definitive assessment.
        - Translation: Translates medical records into over 50 languages, facilitating better access and understanding of medical information.
        - PII Removal: Uses AI or blacklisting options to help remove personally identifiable information from records, enhancing data privacy.
    3. **Data Digitization and Conversion**: The App supports the conversion of various document formats into structured JSON data, utilizing OCR technologies like Tesseract for text recognition, allowing for efficient data management and accessibility.
5. **Payment, Billing, and Feedback**
    1. **Beta Access and Future Subscription Plans**: Currently, the App is in beta and available free of charge, allowing you to test its features and functionality without cost. During this phase, you have access to a limited number of AI tokens and core functionalities to provide feedback and help us improve the Services. As the App evolves based on user feedback, we may introduce subscription plans for premium features and increased AI token limits. Details of any future pricing and subscription options will be provided on our website.
    2. **Billing**: In the event that we transition to a paid model, payments for subscriptions will be processed through third-party payment processors. By subscribing, you will agree to the pricing and payment terms detailed on our website at that time, which may be updated from time to time.
    3. **Feedback and Contributions**: Your feedback is crucial during the beta phase, and CTT may actively request your input to help improve the Services. You are encouraged to provide feedback, which should not be unreasonably withheld, as it plays a significant role in the ongoing development and enhancement of the App. By providing feedback, you authorize CTT to use, incorporate, and implement your feedback without restriction or compensation to you, and you disclaim any right to challenge or seek remedies related to CTT’s use of your feedback.
