- **Med tech** - using Doctor Dok as a framework for product development

## Structured data

Doctor Dok uses standarized JSON format to which parses all input health records. By doing so it opens a way for all exciting new features like data summarization, diagraming, data compression, taking even years long health history into AI context. Things that previously were very difficult or even impossible for human beings.

## Encrypted storage

All the health records (including file attachments) are **encrypted in the browser** before sending to the server. Your private key is never exchanged with the server. Therefore there's no way to access, take over or modify the data. The only exception is if you decide to use Chat GPT which is powering data-parsing, summary, context and conclusion making processes. Even if so, you're up to enter your own Chat GPT API key and the data is being sent directly from your browser to chatGPT subject to [OpenAI privacy policies](https://openai.com/pl-PL/policies/eu-privacy-policy/).

## Getting Started

Virtually no external dependencies. This app uses SQLite to store per-user database of patients and health records. To start the app just run:

```bash
yarn dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.

To use AI features make sure you set your chat GPT API Key in the settings.

Available ENV settings (overrides the UI settings):

```js
export const ENV_PROVIDED_CONFIG = {
  chatGptApiKey: process.env.NEXT_PUBLIC_CHAT_GPT_API_KEY,
  displayAttachmentPreviews: process.env.NEXT_PUBLIC_DISPLAY_ATTACHMENT_PREVIEWS,
